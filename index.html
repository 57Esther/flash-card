                <p>
                    This is a Code First Girls Project builts using html,css and javascript
                    by a team of three aspiring developer. 
                    The project tittled Flashcard is aimed at student who are newly learning how to code,
                    Its an alternative way to learn develop and store relevant coding contents hence 
                    the reason why we have created this project. <strong>
                    Flashcards are small note cards used for testing and improving memory 
                    through practiced information retrieval. Flashcards are typically two-sided,
                    with the prompt on one side and the information about the prompt on the other. 
                    This may include names, vocabulary, concepts, or procedures.
                   </strong>

                         <li>2.Say Your Answers Out Loud While Studying.</li>
                         <li>3.Review the Flashcards You Got Wrong Immediately After Every Practice Session.</li>
                         <li>4.Switch Between Different Subjects Often (Interleaving).</li>
                         <li> 5.Mix Up the Order of Your Questions (Varied Practice).</li>

               <h3>Flashcards</h3>
               <p> A flashcard or flash card is a card bearing information on both sides,
                   which is intended to be used as an aid in memorization. 
                   Each flashcard typically bears a question or definition on one side and
                   an answer or target term on the other. <strong>Flashcards help students to engage in active recall or a process
                   wherein students actively engage in learning by stimulating our memories
                   and creating lasting connections to the material. When you create flashcards,
                   you should incorporate images as well as words to help improve your active recall</strong>
